TauCharts is a javascript graph library. It is based on D3 framework. So why you need it? There are handful of similar libraries, but TauCharts has some unique features.

## Design
Many charting libraries look really ugly. They are created by programmers and not all programmers have deep knowledge about design and information visualization. TauCharts designed with passion by professional designers and information visualization experts. We put significant effort into charts design and think about clarity, ink-to-data ratio, integrity and usability.

## Plugins
TauCharts has nice framework and good extensibility options. Plugins infrastructure is flexible and you can write own plugins easily.

## Flexibility and Power
Most charting libraries just provide a set of charts you can create. It is OK, but in many cases you need more sophisticated visualizations. TauCharts based on [Grammar of Graphic](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) and can draw really complex and interactive visualizations.
