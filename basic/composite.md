## Composite charts

TauCharts API focused on flexible composition architecture instead of rich taxonomy of chart types like many other libraries.

Such an approach allows to build a facet charts by nesting coordinates into coordinates recursively as well as display many different elements (e.g. points, bars, lines) on the chart grid.

Once you understand the composition principles you can build even a facet of facets of facets if you find such a visualization useful.
